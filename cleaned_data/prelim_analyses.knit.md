This document is a preliminary analysis of every Twitter status update created between October 1, 2013 and March 1, 2014 which refers to immigration and contains any of the following terms: Bulgaria/Bulgarian, Romania/Romanian, England, UK, Britain. The sample contains a total of 136960 tweets.

There is a total of 1048 retweets in the sample. I'm pretty sure this is much much fewer than other studies of more specific conversations, suggesting there is a lot of disconnected tweeting.
